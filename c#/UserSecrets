The User Secrets feature in ASP.NET Core is used to securely store sensitive data, such as API keys or passwords, during development.
It allows developers to keep this information out of source code and version control by storing it in a separate secrets.json file specific to the user's development environment.
The data can be accessed in code using the IConfiguration API.
It's important to note that User Secrets is intended for development environments, and more secure methods should be used in production, such as environment variables or dedicated secret management solutions.
